// Sub-agent task budget: how many tasks one ask may dispatch.
//
// The number cannot be a constant. "Test the agents I picked" is an instruction
// whose width the user already stated — the roster — and a fixed ceiling of 3
// silently dropped the fourth pick: three tasks went out, opencode was never
// submitted, and no surface said so. An unbounded fan-out is just as wrong: a
// model looping on task_submit would spawn work until the round budget ran out.
//
// So the budget is derived, and every source can only raise it:
//
//   - defaultTaskBudget — the floor when nothing else applies (a plain ask with
//     no roster and no declared plan).
//   - the roster — one task per agent the user explicitly picked. This is the
//     only *deterministic* statement of width available: it is already
//     validated (panel.cleanTeam) and already enforced at routing, so it needs
//     no reading of the prompt. Parsing "test these 4" out of prose would mean
//     guessing across five locales, and a wrong guess either truncates work or
//     raises a safety limit on a hunch.
//   - task_budget — the model declares how many tasks the round needs, bounded
//     by taskCeiling. That covers the no-roster fan-out ("check these five
//     modules") without the engine trying to read numbers out of a sentence.
//
// Whatever the source, a refusal is never silent: the model gets a tool result
// naming what was dropped and how to raise the limit, and the user gets the
// same fact on Result.Warning.
